Had a lot of fun doing this, most of the JS coding I learned through following tutorials, this was my first JS code I wrote without following anyone :D

It's pretty simple but the feeling I got from having the buttons work was a joy :D

Learned window.onload in this one
Learned how z-index affects links
Learned how to add and remove classes and how to make an added class a priority with !important

Again, I used grid and flexbox interchangeably and it made life a breeze.

Overall it took me 3 hours to build mobile version, 2hrs for JS and another 2hrs for desktop.
