Had a lot of fun doing this, most of the JS coding I learned through following tutorials, this was my first JS code I wrote without following anyone :D

It's pretty simple but the feeling I got from having the button work was a joy :D

Again, I used grid and flexbox interchangeably and it made life a breeze.

Overall it took me 3 hours to build mobile version, 2hrs for JS and another 2hrs for desktop.
